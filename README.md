# Current state
THIS CODE ISNT READY YET.  DONT FORK IT, DONT READ IT, DONT USE IT

# Authorship
This code is heavily (like, **REALLY** heavily.  Like, they did all the hard parts and I just messed around with 
adding typing) taken from https://github.com/DLehenbauer/jszm , which itself is taken from the 
[JSZM v2.0.2](http://zzo38computer.org/jszm/jszm.js) by zzo38.  While no official license statement is 
in the original source, it does state the it is in the "public domain", which for these purposes I am treating
as **at least as open as the MIT licence**.  If it turns out I am wrong about this, and you are one of the upstream
authors, please contact me and we'll get it resolved immediately.
